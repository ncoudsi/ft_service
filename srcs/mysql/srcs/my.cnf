#to the mysqld command line. Istead of typing --any-option after
#mysqld command, you just type any-option in this file (remove --).
#
#Name of the program or group for which you want to set options.
#After a group line, any option-setting lines apply to the named group
#until the end of the option file or another group line is given.
#Here, applies options to then entire mysqld program.
[mysqld]
#Specify user.
user=root

#NOTES :
#skip-networking controls whether the server permits TCP/IP connections. When it is on, it disables TCP/IP
#and allows only local connections. Here we need TCP/IP since we go through K8s and MetalLB to access our services.
#Here, no skip-networking at all, default value being 'OFF'.
